My audience is people who enjoy playing clicker games and people who like birds.

My project is a simple iterative game where players can feed birds. The birds leave trinkets which the player uses as currency to buy items like bird feeders, bird fountains, or fancier birdseed, all of which have various benefits like attracting birds into the player’s garden and increasing the rewards that the player gets.

The content will be a simple text-based display that shows the resources at the player’s disposal and contains buttons for various actions. There is also an area where messages will display to alert the user to various events in the game.

The user only has one button to press on the default landing page. As they continue to click it and accumulate currency they will be given the ability to spend it and to manipulate various resources and items.
